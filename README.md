# Lucky Draw Check-In App (Frontend)

This repository contains the frontend code for the Lucky Draw Check-In application. This application allows users to check in for a lucky draw event.

## Description

The Lucky Draw Check-In App is a web application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a user-friendly interface for participants to check in to a lucky draw event. The application includes features for both participant check-in and administrator prize management.

## Supabase Setup

This application uses Supabase for its backend. Before running the application, you need to create a Supabase project and set up a database table.

1. **Create a Supabase Project:** Sign up for a Supabase account and create a new project. You'll receive a `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

2. **Create the `participants` Table:** Use the following SQL command to create the `participants` table in your Supabase database:

   ```sql
   create table
     public.participants (
       id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
       name text not null,
       empid text not null,
       serviceline text null,
       email text not null,
       rank text null,
       category text not null default 'general'::text,
       registered boolean not null default false,
       registereddatetime timestamp with time zone null,
       successfullyusedfacerecognition boolean null,
       isdrawn boolean not null default false,
       prizewon numeric null,
       donation numeric null,
       donationdatetime timestamp with time zone null,
       constraint participants_pkey primary key (id),
       constraint participants_empid_key unique (empid),
       constraint participants_empid_length check (
         (
           (length(empid) >= 5)
           and (length(empid) <= 7)
         )
       )
     ) tablespace pg_default;
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:** Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with your Supabase project details.

## Face Scan Backend Setup

For face scan functionality, a [separate backend service](https://github.com/seanntxj/lucky_draw_check_in_face_scan_backend) is required. Refer to its README for detailed setup instructions.


## Kinde Setup

This application uses Kinde for authentication. You will need to create a Kinde project and obtain the necessary client ID and secret.

1. **Create a Kinde Project:** Create a new project on the Kinde platform.  You will receive a `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` and `KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:** Add the `KINDE_CLIENT_ID` and `KINDE_CLIENT_SECRET` to your `.env` file.
